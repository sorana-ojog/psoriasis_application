# Psoriasis Application

This is the application that I created for my final year project at The University of Manchester. It is a cross-platform application created using Flutter.

## Getting Started

You can check the final product out at https://psoriasis-app.web.app/#/ .

If you want to see some accounts that already have data sent to the database, you could login using any of the following:

```
Patient account: 
username: misu@yahoo.com
password: sorana123
```

```
Doctor account:
username: maria.smith@gmail.com
password: sorana123
```

Otherwise, you can sign up as a doctor using any 9-digit code (e.g.: 458359295) or as a patient using the code from one of the registered doctors (e.g.: qiHKMbMtFL). Also, bear in mind that every user can only complete and send one questionnaire/day.
